TCC Extension

First import the module like so:

var tcc = require('./tcc');

The only method you can call from the tcc var is the init method. The init method takes seven parameters:

tcc.init(app, uri, dbUri, t, afterReservationCallback, deleteCallback, finalCallback);

app is the application variable created with express.js. 
uri is the URI from which you want your TCC client to be addressed when doing a reservation. In the test file you can see that it's set as '/buy/:item', for example. Any path can be used.
dbUri is the URI of the database. This particular version of the TCC Extension uses mongodb, thus we need a mongodb database up and running.
t is the timeout you want to give to your service. When the timeout expires the reservation will automatically be cancelled. 
afterReservationCallback is a callback function executed when the reservation of an item is done.
deleteCallback is a callback function executed when a reservation is cancelled.
finalCallback is a callback function executed when a user performs a confirmation (PUT request).
